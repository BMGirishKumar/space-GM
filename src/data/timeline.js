      "The day it went from strangers on a screen to something that quietly felt different. What was supposed to be just a few messages turned into us talking and talking, and suddenly it felt like we had known each other for much longer.",

    text:
      "Our first date, the day we finally stepped out of chat and into real life. There were nerves, excitement, and that feeling of “oh wow, this is actually happening” every time our eyes met.",

      "Our second date, but the first one that felt properly planned and intentional. We weren’t just meeting up, we were choosing each other, making time, and slowly building our own little routine together.",

      "The bike ride where the wind, the roads, and Phoenix mall all became background noise to us just being together. That ride is still one of those memories that plays in slow motion in the heart.",

      "At Bessy Beach, right after stepping out from the kovil, the words finally came out: “I love you.” The waves were loud, but that moment was somehow quiet, soft, and very, very real.",

    title: "Girlfriend Day",
    text:
      "Girlfriend Day felt less like a day and more like a tiny celebration of the fact that somehow, out of everyone, it turned out to be us. Another excuse to go out, laugh, and just exist side by side.",
